      <h5>Sean's Background</h5>
      <p>I have a background revolving around athletics. I have had the privilege of representing my home country of
        Canada and competing internationally in the sport I love. I decided to start learning coding because it appears
        to be an exciting and interesting career path after I hang up the track spikes.</p>
