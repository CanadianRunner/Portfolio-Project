# _Sean Keane's Portfolio_

#### By _**Sean Keane**_

#### _This is a Portfolio I created to provide some insight into "Sean Keane" as a developer.  This is project represents two weeks of study at Epicodus and my attempt to navigate HTML, CSS, Markdown, and Github._

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS
* Markdown

## Description

_This is application is my "Portfolio Landing Page".  I used HTML to craft the majority of what you see informationally.  I used CSS to manipulate the text (colours, sizing, outlines, etc).  I utilized "CSS Bootstrap" to create a navigation buttons, along with fun interactive pieces such as the rotating progress bar.  This project while appearing simple took me a considerable amount of time to implement.  But considering just a couple weeks ago I wouldn't have been able to do anything with the terminal, let alone create/manipulate an HTML I'm happy with the result._
